            <strong>Debt Ceiling:</strong> Maximum number of DAI that can be issued<br />
            <strong>Debt (Dai):</strong> Amount of outstanding DAI debt in a CDP<br />
            <strong>Deficit:</strong> Whether the system is at less than 100% overall collateralisation<br />
            <strong>Draw:</strong> Create Dai against a CDP<br />
            <strong>ETH:</strong> Ethereum<br />

            <strong>Liq. Ratio:</strong> Collateralization ratio below which a CDP may be liquidated<br />

            <strong>Safe:</strong> Whether the overall collateralization of the system is above the liquidation ratio<br />
            <strong>DAI Target Rate:</strong> Annual % change of Dai target price in USD. This represents Dai deflation or inflation when positive or negative, respectively<br />
            <strong>DAI/USD:</strong> Target price for 1 DAI in USD<br />
            <strong>PETH:</strong> The token used as collateral in CDPs which represents a claim on the ETH collateral pool of the Dai Stablecoin System<br />
            <strong>PETH/ETH:</strong> Amount of collateral pool ETH claimed by 1 PETH<br />
